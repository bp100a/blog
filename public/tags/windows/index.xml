      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo I&amp;rsquo;m a lefty. This meant in high school when the gym teacher would demonstrate a technique for any sport, my instruction was basically &amp;ldquo;and if you&amp;rsquo;re lefthanded use the opposite hands&amp;rdquo;. Being a developer that likes to use Windows as my development platform feels a lot like those days. Most open source projects provide only cursory instructions on setting up their tools on Windows, and the amount of information out there in StackOverflow and other sites is similarly lacking.</description>
