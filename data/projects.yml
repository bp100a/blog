    project: LogicParser
    account: bp100a
    description: A logic parser. Basically parses & executes embedded logic strings to support conditional surveys. Striving for speed and simplicity. This was written in 2008, I had stepped away from hands-on programmer for awhile and wanted to tryout a simple (but useful) project that utilized TDD principles.

    project: Raspberry Pi Photogrammetry
    account: bp100a
    description: A photogrammetry device implemented in Python on the Raspberry Pi. Photogrammetry is the process of producing a 3D model of an object by taking multiple photographs from various angles, the model is generated by specialized software (e.g. Agisoft) that recognizes features and constructs a 3D model from the 2D photos. The more photos and differing angles, the better the result (and the longer it takes the photogrammetry s/w to generate). This solution runs a 3D printed rig with stepper motors, limit switches and a Nikon Coolpix S3300 camera to automate the process.
